# Lecture 5: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE)

## Overview üåê

In this lecture, we dive into the advanced domain of Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE). We'll explore how VQ-VAE stands out in the realm of generative models, particularly in high-fidelity data generation. The focus will be on understanding the unique vector quantization mechanism and how it enhances the generative capabilities of traditional VAEs.
