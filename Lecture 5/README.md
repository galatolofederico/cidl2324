# Lecture 5: Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders

## Overview üåê

This lecture delves into the realm of Autoencoders (AEs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), key models in unsupervised learning that are essential for understanding data compression and generation. We'll explore the underlying principles that enable these networks to learn efficient representations and generate new data instances that are similar to the ones they were trained on.

- [ex1.ipynb](./ex1.ipynb) Solution to the first exercise
- [ex2.ipynb](./ex2.ipynb) Solution to the second exercise
- [ex2_logvar.ipynb](./ex2_logvar.ipynb) Solution to the second exercise with the encoder producing log(std^2) instead of std, numerically more stable
