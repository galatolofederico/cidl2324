# Lecture 7: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

## Overview üåê

This lecture delves into the exciting world of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), focusing on their evolution and advancements through Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs) and Auxiliary Conditional GANs (ACGANs). We'll explore the foundational principles of GANs, their deep learning enhancements in DCGANs, and the role of conditioning in ACGANs.
